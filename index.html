            <h2 class="main">What is the compendium?</h2>
            <p class="main">This is a collection of family recipes, some old and some new. There are a couple sections which sort these into either 
                by meal time or occasion. Underneath each recipe are some comments others who have made the recipe have left. If you have a suggestion
                to make on a recipe make sure to log in and you will be able to leave a comment underneath each recipe.
