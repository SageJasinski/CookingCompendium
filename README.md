# The Compendium

The cooking compendium is a collection of old family recipies collected from torn pages or rundown index cards that risk being lost unless digitized. This site is both desktop and mobile freindly so you can look up these recpies on the go or in the kitchen. Our philosophy was to keep this sites design as simple and easy on the eyes as it is user focused.

some features comming soon are:
- user accounts
- comments under each recipie
- user feed back to the comments and recipies in the form of reactions

**please visit the site at [cookingcompendium.com](http://www.cookingcompendium.com)**

We are aware of a couple bugs in the site and are working to fix them up as the site is still in active develoupment. thank you for your patience.
